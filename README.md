# UMS-User Mode Scheduling
The goal of this project is to create an infrastructure to allow a user-mode process to schedule its own threads without involving the kernel's scheduler. This goal has been reached through the developement of a kernel module and a library that exposes some API needed by the client applications to switch between threads.
